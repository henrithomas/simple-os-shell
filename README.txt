This program, myShell.c, is a basic implementation of a shell. 
Compile and then run the executable:
"./myshell"

The shell supports changing directories, file redirects, and simple piping 
between processes.

The supported functionalities work like so:
Changing directories: "cd new_directory"
Redirects: "command < [or] > file_name"
Piping: "command1 | command2"
